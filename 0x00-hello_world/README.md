# holbertonschool-low_level_programming/0x00-hello_world


Overview: This project is about understanding the basics of the C programming language, including its history, the compiling process, and writing basic scripts.


0-preprocessor - this script runs a C file (stored in the variable named $CFILE) through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file named c
1-compiler - this script complies a C file (stored in the variable named $CFILE) and outputs it to a .o file, but does not link it
2-assembler - this script generates the assembly code of a C file (stored in the variable named $CFILE) and saves that assembly code to an output file named main.s
3-name - this script compiles a C file (stored in the variable named $CFILE) and creates an executable named cisfun
4-puts.c - this C program uses the puts function to print ‘“Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle’, followed by a new line, and returns the value 0
5-printf.c - this C program uses the printf function to print ‘with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,’, followed by a new line, returns the value 0, and compiles without warning when using the -Wall gcc option
6-size.c - this C program prints the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on and returns 0
