# holbertonschool-low_level_programming/0x03-more_functions_nested_loops

Overview: This project takes a deeper dive into writing C functions with nested loops.

0-isupper.c - this function checks to see if a character is uppercase
1-isdigit.c - this function checks to see if a character is a digit between 0 and 9
2-mul.c - this function multiplies two integers
3-print_numbers.c - function prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
4-print_most_numbers.c - this function prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line - except for 2 and 4
5-more_numbers.c - this function that prints numbers from 0 to 14, 10 times, followed by a new line
6-print_line.c - this function draws a straight line in the terminal
7-print_diagonal.c - this function draws a diagonal line on the terminal
8-print_square.c - function that prints a square
9-fizz_buzz.c - this program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
10-print_triangle.c - this function prints a triangle, followed by a new line
